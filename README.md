# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python to understand patterns, relationships, and missing values.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
- Summary statistics (mean, std, median)
- Visualizations: Histograms, Boxplots, KDE plots
- Correlation analysis and pair plots
- Handling missing values
- Feature-level insights and inferences

## 🧠 Key Observations
- Female and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates
- Age had missing values and slight right skew
- Cabin feature was dropped due to too many missing values
- Fare and Pclass correlated with survival

## 📁 Files
- `eda_titanic.ipynb` – Notebook with all EDA code and visualizations
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` – Original dataset
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset after processing
